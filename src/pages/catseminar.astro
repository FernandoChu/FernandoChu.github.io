    "Léonard Guetta - When Does Cocompleteness Imply Completeness? A Primer on the Theory of Total Categories.",
    `It is a well-known result in poset theory that a poset admitting all joins automatically admits all meets. While the straightforward generalization to categories is true—a category admitting all (possibly large) colimits also admits all (possibly large) limits—it is practically useless due to Freyd's famous result, which states that in such cases, the category is necessarily a poset. Therefore, standard examples of categories (Set, Ab, Grp, etc.) do not satisfy this property.
However, the correct generalization of this poset result to category theory is the following:
A totally cocomplete category (referred to as a "total category") is automatically complete.
The goal of this talk is to introduce the elegant notion of a total category, a strong and natural cocompleteness property introduced by Street and Walters in 1978, which many standard categories possess. For example, all locally presentable categories are total. However, unlike local presentability—which is rarely self-dual (it is almost never the case that a category is both locally and co-locally presentable)—many categories are both total and cototal, synthesizing very nice and convenient (co)completeness properties that a category can have.`,

    "Niek Mulleners - Example-Based Reasoning about the Realizability of Polymorphic Programs",
    `Parametricity states that parametrically polymorphic functions behave the same regardless of how they are instantiated. When developing polymorphic programs, Wadler’s free theorems can serve as free specifications, which can turn otherwise partial specifications into total ones, and can make otherwise realizable specifications unrealizable.
We are interested in automating the process of computing the realizability of polymorphic programs specified by a set of monomorphic input-output examples. We restrict ourselves to those polymorphic programs that are natural transformations between strictly positive functors, allowing us to make use of the isomorphism between such programs and container morphisms (morphisms between polynomial endofunctors). By translating monomorphic input-output examples to constraints on container morphisms, we can compute the realizability of polymorphic programs implementing those examples.`,

    "Paige North - Coinductive control of inductive data types",
    `In classical programming language theory, characterizing data types as initial algebras of an endofunctor that represents a specification of the data types is an important tool. In this work, we observe that the category of algebras of such an endofunctor is often enriched in its category of coalgebras. This enrichment carries strictly more information than the traditional, unenriched category. For example, when considering the endofunctor whose initial algebra is the natural numbers, we find that the enrichment encodes a notion of 'partial' homomorphism, while the unenriched category encodes only 'total' homomorphisms. We can also leverage this extra information to generalize the notion of initial algebras, following the theory of weighted limits.`,

    "I'll talk about one particular Grothendieck topos, which is most straighforwardly defined as the topos of sheaves for the countable cover Grothendieck topology on a certain small category. Surprisingly, this topology is both canonical and dense, hence the topos is boolean. Its classical internal logic validates the axiom of dependent choice and also the existence of a translation-invariant measure, extending Lebesgue measure, defined on all subsets of the reals. The measure can be uniquely characterised by exploiting an intrinsic independence relation, closely related to the Day monoidal structure on the topos.",

    "Niels van der Weide - The internal languages of univalent categories",
    `Internal language theorems are fundamental in categorical logic, since they express an equivalence between syntax and semantics. One of such theorems was proven by Clairambault and Dybjer, who corrected the result originally by Seely. More specifically, they constructed a biequivalence between the bicategory of locally Cartesian closed categories and the bicategory of democratic categories with families with extensional identity types, ∑-types, and ∏-types. This theorem expresses that, up to adjoint equivalence, the internal language of locally Cartesian closed categories is extensional Martin-Löf type theory with dependent sums and products.
In this talk, we prove the theorem by Clairambault and Dybjer for univalent categories, and we extend their biequivalence to various classes of toposes, among which are ∏-pretoposes and elementary toposes. Univalent categories give an interesting framework for studying internal language theorems of dependent type theory. This is because of the fact that univalent categories are identified up to adjoint equivalence, and that internal language theorems give us biequivalence for various classes of categories and theories. In addition, we shall see that univalence gives us several ways to simplify the necessary constructions and proofs, because it allows us to transfer properties and structure along equivalences for free. 
The results in this paper have been formalized using the proof assistant Coq and the UniMath library. The material in this talk is based on the preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06636.`,

    "Grothendieck's Galois theory sets up an analogy between covering space theory in topology and the Galois theory of fields. After briefly explaining the historical motivation, I will explain an extension of these results to pretopoi with a finite jointly conservative family of fibre functors (models). This gives a quick proof of a (simplified but more computationally feasible) version of the exodromy theorem of Barwick-Glasman-Haine from 2018. Time permitting, I will also sketch the connection to Makkai's strong conceptual completeness theorem and Lurie's ultracategories.",

    `In this talk, I will present recent joint work with Dimitri Ara on the generalization of the Grothendieck construction to ω-categories, focusing on its functorial properties. In order to do so,  we had to work within the realm of lax Gray ω-categories—higher categories in which the interchange law holds only up to a non-invertible cell. Despite the technical nature of this topic, I will assume only a basic familiarity with category theory and will introduce all the necessary notions. I will also highlight how these ideas arise naturally within the broader landscape of higher category theory. Reference: arXiv:2503.08832`,

    "Niels van der Weide - The Univalence Maxim and Univalent Double Categories",
    `Category theory unifies mathematical concepts, aiding comparisons across structures by incorporating not just objects, but also morphisms capturing interactions between objects. It has influenced areas of computer science such as automata theory, functional programming, and semantics. Of particular importance in some applications are double categories, which are categories with two classes of morphisms, axiomatizing two different kinds of interactions between objects. These have found applications in many areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science, for instance, the study of lenses, open systems, and rewriting.
However, double categories come with a wide variety of equivalences, which makes it challenging to transport structure along equivalences. To deal with this challenge, we propose the univalence maxim: each notion of equivalence of categorical structures has a corresponding notion of univalent categorical structure which induces that notion of equivalence. We also prove corresponding univalence principles, which allow us to transport structure and properties along equivalences. In this way, the usually informal practice of reasoning modulo equivalence becomes grounded in an entirely formal logical principle.
We apply this perspective to various double categorical structures, such as (pseudo) double categories and double bicategories. Concretely, we characterize and formalize their definitions in Rocq UniMath up to chosen equivalences, which we achieve by establishing their univalence principles.`,

          The category theory seminar runs every other week at Utrecht
          University. Here category theory is understood in a broad sense, and
          topics can include higher category theory, applications to homotopy
          theory and computer science, among other things. The sessions will
          take up to 1h30m, including questions.
